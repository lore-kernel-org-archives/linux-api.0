During idle page tracking, we see that sometimes faulted anon pages are in
pagevec but are not drained to LRU. Idle page tracking only considers pages
on LRU.

I am able to find multiple issues involving this. One issue looks like
idle tracking is completely broken. It shows up in my testing as if a
page that is marked as idle is always "accessed" -- because it was never
marked as idle (due to not draining of pagevec).

The other issue shows up as a failure during swapping (support for which
this series adds), with the following sequence:
 1. Allocate some pages
 2. Write to them
 3. Mark them as idle                                  <--- fails
 4. Introduce some memory pressure to induce swapping.
 5. Check the swap bit I introduced in this series.    <--- fails to set idle
                                                            bit in swap PTE.

To fix this, this patch drains all CPU's pagevec before starting idle tracking.
