Yes, exactly.  Just as I plan to start making some test kernels for
people to play with (assuming v6 looks okay), I think it would be good
if Steve could make a test build of the latest audit userspace with
the audit container ID patches.  It really shouldn't be that hard, and
the benefits should far outweigh any time spent generating the
tree/builds.
