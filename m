Thread based control for namespace is not a different problem from
thread based control for individual applications, right?  And the
problems with using cgroupfs directly for in-process control still
applies the same whether it's system-wide or inside a namespace.

One argument could be that inside a namespace, as the cgroupfs is
already scoped, cgroup path headaches are less of an issue, which is
true; however, that isn't applicable to applications which aren't
scoped in thier own namespaces and we can't scope every binary on the
system.  More importnatly, a given application can't rely on being
scoped in a certain way.  You can craft a custom config for a specific
setup but that's a horrible way to solve the problem of in-application
hierarchical resource distribution, and that's what rgroup was all
about.

Thanks.
