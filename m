 User API
 ========
+There are 2 ways to access the idle page tracking API. One uses physical
+address indexing, another uses a simpler virtual address indexing scheme.

+Physical address indexing
+-------------------------
+The idle page tracking API for physical address indexing using page frame
+numbers (PFN) is located at ``/sys/kernel/mm/page_idle``.  Currently, it
+consists of the only read-write file, ``/sys/kernel/mm/page_idle/bitmap``.
 
 The file implements a bitmap where each bit corresponds to a memory page. The
 bitmap is represented by an array of 8-byte integers, and the page at PFN #i is

 information about ``/proc/pid/pagemap``, ``/proc/kpageflags``, and
 ``/proc/kpagecgroup``.
 
+Virtual address indexing
+------------------------
+The idle page tracking API for virtual address indexing using virtual frame
+numbers (VFN) for a process ``<pid>`` is located at ``/proc/<pid>/page_idle``.
+It is a bitmap that follows the same semantics as
+``/sys/kernel/mm/page_idle/bitmap`` except that it uses virtual instead of
+physical frame numbers.
+
+This idle page tracking API does not deal with PFN so it does not require prior
+lookups of ``pagemap``. This is an advantage on some systems where looking up
+PFN is considered a security issue.  Also in some cases, this interface could
+be slightly more reliable to use than physical address indexing, since in
+physical address indexing, address space changes can occur between reading the
+``pagemap`` and reading the ``bitmap``, while in virtual address indexing, the
+process's ``mmap_sem`` is held for the duration of the access.
+
+To estimate the amount of pages that are not used by a workload one should:
+
+ 1. Mark all the workload's pages as idle by setting corresponding bits in
+    ``/proc/<pid>/page_idle``.
+
+ 2. Wait until the workload accesses its working set.
+
+ 3. Read ``/proc/<pid>/page_idle`` and count the number of bits set.
