FWIW, I totally agree with the time-to-check-time-to-react problem. However,
I'd like to clarify the ActivityManager/SystemServer case (I'll call it
SystemServer from now on)

For Android, every application (including the special SystemServer) are forked
from Zygote. The reason ofcourse is to share as many libraries and classes between
the two as possible to benefit from the preloading during boot.

After applications start, (almost) all of the APIs  end up calling into this
SystemServer process over IPC (binder) and back to the application.

In a fully running system, the SystemServer monitors every single process
periodically to calculate their PSS / RSS and also decides which process is
"important" to the user for interactivity.

So, because of how these processes start _and_ the fact that the SystemServer
is looping to monitor each process, it does tend to *know* which address
range of the application is not used / useful.

Besides, we can never rely on applications to clean things up themselves.
We've had the "hey app1, the system is low on memory, please trim your
memory usage down" notifications for a long time[1]. They rely on
applications honoring the broadcasts and very few do.

So, if we want to avoid the inevitable killing of the application and
restarting it, some way to be able to tell the OS about unimportant memory in
these applications will be useful.
