We're discussing the audit container ID management policy elsewhere in
this thread so I won't comment on that here, but I did want to say
that we will likely need something better than a simple list of audit
container IDs from the start.  It's common for systems to have
thousands of containers now (or multiple thousands), which tells me
that a list is a poor choice.  You mentioned a hash table, so I would
suggest starting with that over the list for the initial patchset.
