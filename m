Yeah, I was thinking about for testing/debugging purposes so that we
could use keyctl to examine the per-file system keyring and see what
keys are attached to a file system.  This is only going to be usable
by root, so I guess we can just try to figure it out by going through
/proc/keys and searching by sb->s_id.  If there are ambiguities that
make this hard to do, we can add an interface to make this easier.
